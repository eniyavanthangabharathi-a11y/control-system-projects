## Pole Placement Interpretation

As the closed-loop poles are moved further left in the complex plane,
the system response becomes faster with reduced settling time.

Physically, moving poles left corresponds to increasing the feedback
forces opposing displacement and velocity. This increases the effective
stiffness and damping of the system, allowing it to respond and settle
more quickly.

However, aggressive pole placement increases control effort and can
lead to sensitivity to noise and modeling errors. This highlights the
trade-off between speed and robustness in feedback control design.
