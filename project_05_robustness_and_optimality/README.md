## Robustness Interpretation

Aggressive controllers achieve faster responses but amplify disturbances and noise, making them sensitive to uncertainty. 
More conservative controllers respond slower but maintain stable and predictable behavior under external disturbances.
This demonstrates that stability alone is insufficient, and robustness must be considered in practical control design.
