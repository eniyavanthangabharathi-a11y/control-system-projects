## LQR Control Interpretation

LQR designs controllers by explicitly balancing state performance and control effort, rather than enforcing dynamics alone.
By tuning the weighting matrices, the controller trades response speed for reduced actuator effort and improved robustness.
Compared to pole placement, LQR produces smoother and more realistic control behavior suitable for real-world systems.
