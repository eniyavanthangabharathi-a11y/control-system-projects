# Objective
Study steady-state and transient behavior of a mass–spring–damper system under
open-loop, P control, and PI control in the presence of constant disturbance.

# Plant Model
G(s) = 1 / (2s² + 2s + 4)

DC gain = 1/k = 0.25

# Experiments
1. Open loop with disturbance
2. Closed loop with P controller
3. Closed loop with PI controller

# Key Observations
- Open loop: steady-state offset proportional to disturbance
- P control: reduced offset, not zero
- PI control: zero steady-state offset due to integral action

# Conclusion
Integral action is required to eliminate steady-state error caused by constant disturbances.
